			<h1> &#10025; about me &#10025; </h1>
			<h2> Biography </h2>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;"> I was born in Brazil in 2003 and later moved to Canada with
				my family at the age of 13. Since I was a little kid, I have always loved to play video games. It
				started with those simple browser games, then I got into online multiplayer games. Because I spend most
				of my time on the computer, I became more interested in computers, and thus decided to pursue
				information technology. I highly value my education and try my best to achieve high grades across all
				of my classes. However, I'm also the type to make time for my hobbies as well and not let school
				responsibilities completely consume my time. <br> I've developed a variety of computer technical skills
				in
				both high school and university, so I would say I know a little bit of a lot of things. These include
				image manipulation, video and audio editing, data manipulation, and coding.<br><br>
			</p>

			<h2> Interests </h2>
			<ul>
				<li><span>GAMES</span> I enjoy playing co-op games with my friends and chill games by myself. I own
					over 200 games and need to get back to it because these games aren't going to play themselves.</li>
				<br>
				<li><span>ARTS & CRAFTS</span> Although I'm new to it and not particularly good, I like painting,
					crocheting, and making flowers out of pipe cleaners.</li><br>
				<li><span>EDITING IMAGES</span> A few years ago, I used to have classes involving Photoshop. At home,
					I would create profile pictures and funny logos for my friends.</li><br>
				<li><span>COLLECTING PLUSHIES</span> I love plushies very much, but mostly the ones that have very
					soft "fur". When it comes to gift giving, I feel like I'm the easiest person to gift because of my
					love for plushies and how you can never have enough. I've owned about a hundred of them! </li>
