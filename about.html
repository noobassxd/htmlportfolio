			<h1> &#10025; about me &#10025; </h1>
			<br>
			<h2> Biography </h2>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;"> I was born in Brazil in 2003 and later moved to Canada with
				my family at the age of 13. Since I was a little kid, I have always loved to play video games. It
				started with those simple browser games, then I got into online multiplayer games. Because I spend most
				of my time on the computer, I became more interested in computers, and thus decided to pursue
				information technology. I highly value my education and try my best to achieve high grades across all
				of my classes. However, I'm also the type to make time for my hobbies as well and not let school
				responsibilities completely consume my time. <br> I've developed a variety of computer technical skills in
				both high school and university, so I would say I know a little bit of a lot of things. These include
				image manipulation, video and audio editing, data manipulation, and coding.<br><br></p>
